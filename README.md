Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project  

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to look at data about Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 - 2017. In doing so, we may be able to gather insights about the data. Also it may lead us to make better decisions going further.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 
From this data and consequent line graph, we can see that theater Kickstarters launched in May have a high success rate. We can also see that there are alot of Kickstarters started around that time.  The data also suggests that there is a lower amount of theater Kickstarters launched toward the end of the year.  The number of canceled Kickstarters for theater is almost constant through the year. https://github.com/samnougues/kickstarter-analysis/blob/f07c674e2a46a553cbda139b1498c8ad10b811d8/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This data and line graph shows that the success rate of Play kickstarters are at the highest when the goal is below 1000 dollars.  Then there is a decline between 1000 and 29999. After that success rate increases again until the goals are around 35,000; then it plataeus until 40,000.  After that, there is a sharp decline; until it bounces back up again at 45,000 ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) [Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](path/to/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlxs)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I did not encounter any challenges or difficulties. However, I can understand how someone could get confused about the countifs.  The countifs equations are bit finnicky.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

I have concluded that the most Theater Kickstarters are launched in May. Also, because of that May has the highest number of successes. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I conclude that the kickstarters with a goal under 1000 dollars that the best rate of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

I think one of the limitations of the table with outcomes based on goals for plays is that we don't have a lot of data on kickstarters at the higher end so the sample size is too small to be helpful for a sound conclusion on the data. Another limitation is there should be a column on advertising.  I would like to know if getting the word out about the kickstarter effects the outcome. There are also other confounding Factors not included in the info, for example if the person who created it was famous prior to making the Kickstarter.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could have a line graph on the the duration of the Kickstarter and the succes and fail rate.  We could also have a chart for the success and fail rate of Technology Kick starters.
